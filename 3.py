# 1. Ask the user to enter a float value between 0 and 1 and save
# it to a variable called "grade". Also have the user enter their
# name and save it to a variable called "name".


# 2. Print out a nice statement that looks like "____ has a ___% in
# this class.", where the first blank is their name, and the second
# blank is their grade formatted to show 2 decimal places and as a percent.


# 3. Ask the user to enter an amount of money as a float. Save it to
# a variable named "cash". Print out a nice statement that looks like
# "_____ has $_____ in their bank account.", where the first blank is
# their name, and the second blank is their cash, formatted to two
# decimal places and commas to separate thousands.


# 4. Generate a list called "random_numbers" of 10 random integers between
# 0 and 100.


# 5. Go through "random_numbers" and print out the maximum grade.


# 6. Print out the index of the maximum grade in "random_numbers"


# 7. Go through "random_numbers" and print out the average grade.


# 8. Add a 100 to "random_numbers", and recalculate the average.


# 9. Print out the odd numbers from 0 to 50.


# 10. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates
# and returns the range (that is the maximum minus the minimum).


# 11. Create a function that takes in two lists of numbers and returns
# the higher average between the two of them.


# 12. Create a "Student" class.  It should have an initializer that takes
# in variables for "name", "age", and "grade_level".  Make a string method
# to help print out an individual student.  Make each one a property with a
# getter and setter method.  Make a method called "school_year_end" that
# will increase their grade level by one when called.


# 13. Create a student object in a variable called "me". Call your
# "school_year_end" method and print our the student afterwards.
