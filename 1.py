# 1. Create two integer variables, labeled "int1" and "int2".
# Set "int1" to be 10, and "int2" to be 23.


# 2. Print out the result of multiplying the two variables together.


# 3. Create a third integer variable labeled "int3" with the value 17.


# 4. Print out the sum of all three integer variables.


# 5. Print out the result of raising "int1" to the power of "int3".


# 6. Create two float variables named "float1" and "float2".
# Set "float1" to be 2.4 and "float2" to be 15.88.


# 7. Print out the result of doing integer division between "int3" and
# "float1", i.e. "int3" integer divided by "float1".


# 8. Create two boolean variables named "bool1" and "bool2".
# Set "bool1" to be True and "bool2" to be False.


# 9. Print out the result of combining "bool1" and "bool2" with or.
