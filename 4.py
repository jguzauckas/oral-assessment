# 1. Ask the user to enter an integer between 0 and 10.
# Raise a ValueError if the user enters a value outside
# of that range or a TypeError if they don't enter a number.
# If nothing goes wrong, print out a sentence telling them their number.


# 2. Create a list of 10,000 random numbers (between 0 and 1) and
# send the list to a file named "random.json".


# 3. Read in the list of 10,000 random numbers from the file "random.json"
# and save it to a variable named "random_nums". Write a function to determine
# the range of the list (maximum minus minimum) and call it, printing the result.


# 4. Create a "Student" class.  It should have an initializer that takes
# in variables for "age", "grade_level" and "gpa".  Make a string method
# to help print out an individual student.  Make each one a property with a
# getter and setter method.


# 5. Generate a list of a random number of students (between 5,000 and 1,0000),
# with ages between 12 and 18, grade levels between 9 and 12, and GPA's between
# 1.0 and 4.0. Send that list to a file named "students.json".


# 6. Read in the list of students from the file "students.json". Print out the
# student at index 9,000, handling the IndexError if necessary.


# 7. Write a function that will find the senior with the highest GPA and return
# the index of that senior given a list of students.
