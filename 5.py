# Generate a list of 100 random integers from 0 to 100.
#
# Create a function called "sum_to" that takes in a list of integers and
# a target integer, and returns True if there is a combination of two
# integers in the list that sum to the target integer and False if not.
#
# Call your function on your list and the number 123 and print the result.


# Generate a list of 10 random integers from 0 to 9.
#
# Create a function called "addTo" that takes in a list of integers, a
# power value from 0 to 9, and a digit value from 0 to 9.
#
# The list represents an integer broken up into individual digits, where
# the first digit represents the highest place value (in this case
# 1,000,000,000), and so on down until the last digit represents the ones value.
#
# This function will add an amount given by the digit value to the place
# value they choose (i.e. 5 will add to the place value representing 100,000).
# This should include carrying up to the next place value if necessary.
#
# Call the function on your list, the place value 4, and the digit value 6
# and print out the result.
