This repository contains 5 Python files containing problems of increasing difficulty. `1` represents the simplest problems and `5` represents the hardest problems.

This is to be used for our Oral/Practical exam, where students will do select problems out of these files that I request. Students are not expected to be able to complete problems of all difficulty levels, especially in the short amount of time. The goal of the exam is to challenge students thinking and work on their ability to describe their work and thought processes.
